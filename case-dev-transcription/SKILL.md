# case.dev Transcription

Audio and video transcription with speaker diarization, ideal for depositions, hearings, and recorded proceedings. Supports MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, WEBM, and MP4 up to 5GB.

Requires the `casedev` CLI. See `case-dev` skill for installation and auth.

## Start a Transcription

The source file must be in a vault:

```bash
casedev transcribe run --vault VAULT_ID --object OBJECT_ID --json
```

The object must be an audio or video file. Non-media files are rejected.

Flags:
- `--speaker-labels` — enable speaker diarization
- `--speakers-expected N` — hint for number of speakers
- `--language` — language code (e.g., `en`, `es`)
- `--format` — output format
- `--auto-highlights` — extract key phrases

Uses focused vault if set via `casedev focus set --vault`.

## Check Status

```bash
casedev transcribe status TRANSCRIPTION_ID --json
```

Returns: ID, status, vault, source/result object IDs, audio duration, word count, confidence.

Statuses: `queued` → `processing` → `completed` or `failed`.

## Get Result

```bash
casedev transcribe result TRANSCRIPTION_ID --json
```

Returns the transcript text. If the result is stored as a vault object, it fetches the text automatically. Fails if the job is not yet completed.

## Watch Until Complete

```bash
casedev transcribe watch TRANSCRIPTION_ID --json
```

Polls until done, then prints the result. Flags:
- `--interval` / `-i` — poll interval in seconds (default: 3)
- `--timeout` / `-t` — max wait in seconds (default: 900)

## Common Workflow

### Transcribe a deposition recording

```bash
# 1. Upload to vault
casedev vault object upload ./deposition-2024-01-15.mp3 --vault VAULT_ID --json

# 2. Start transcription with speaker labels
casedev transcribe run --vault VAULT_ID --object OBJECT_ID --speaker-labels --speakers-expected 4 --json

# 3. Watch until complete
casedev transcribe watch TRANSCRIPTION_ID --json

# 4. Or check status + get result separately
casedev transcribe status TRANSCRIPTION_ID --json
casedev transcribe result TRANSCRIPTION_ID --json
```

### Using the job tracker

```bash
# Transcription jobs are auto-tracked
casedev jobs list --type transcribe --json
casedev jobs watch JOB_ID --type transcribe --json
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Invalid file type for transcribe"**: Only audio/video MIME types are accepted. Check the object with `casedev vault object list --vault VAULT_ID`. Upload audio files, not PDFs.

**"Invalid object ID for this vault"**: Run `casedev vault object list --vault VAULT_ID` to see valid IDs.

**"Transcription is not complete yet"**: Wait for the job to finish. Use `casedev transcribe watch` or `casedev jobs watch`.

**Transcription failed**: Check `casedev transcribe status TRANSCRIPTION_ID --json` for the error message. Common causes: corrupted file, unsupported codec, file too large.

**Long audio (2+ hours)**: Increase timeout with `--timeout 3600`. Large files take proportionally longer.
